GameMaker 8.1 Decompiler
========================

This is the old source code (circa 2011) for the GameMaker 8.1 decompiler.
Source expanded on from the original GameMaker 8.0 decompiler with the new (now old) Gmk library replacing the original GMK serialization library.

Usage
-----

To use the decompiler you simply drag an GM8.1 or GM8.0 executable onto the Decompiler icon and the decompilation process will begin. If no GMK is created, execute the decompiler from the command line "decompiler <exe-name>", it should tell you what's wrong.

Future development
------------------

This was the original public release of the GameMaker 8.1 decompiler, uploaded now to keep in sync with the style of the new x2048 website. There are a few bugs in this version that have purposely been left in indefinitely because they act as a backdoor to prevent decompilation of some games, this technique has been passed on to developers who come to make asking how to protect their games. These may be fixed if I decide to continue development.
Of course, the decompiler is licensed under MIT so anyone else is free to find and fix these bugs themselves and circulate a modified decompiler.
